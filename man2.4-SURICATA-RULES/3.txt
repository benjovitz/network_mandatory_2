correct usage of flags


Will alert from any source-ip and any source port. To the router IP on any destination port. 
classtype = predefined classtypes which we set here, for classification. This has the class DOS.
Threshold will look at the number of packages sent and only alert when it hits that treshold.
priority overrides the priority set by the class.
