alert http $HOME_NET any -> 165.232.77.195 any (msg:"Homenet attempted login to kallas.dk/basic.php"; content:"GET"; http_method; content:"/basic.php"; http_uri; flow:to_server; sid:1000001; rev:1;)

$HOME_NET is a builtin variable from suricata.

this rule checks if any from the home net tries to sign in at at kallas.dk, it checks if its a GET request and /basic.php to check if the user is activevly trying to sign in. Flow just adds more direction to the rule and looks for a flow to the server.
